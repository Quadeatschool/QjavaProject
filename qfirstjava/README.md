# Overview

I'm atttempting to make a basic skilltree like one would see in video game. This project will give me a chance to learn java in wide variety of aspects.

-----------------------------------

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}
My program creates skills that are depended on previous skills being completed in order new ones to be unlocked. 

My purpose in writing this soft ware is to gain an understanding of the java programming language.

-------------------------------------

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I made a class dragram to oraganize my plan. I used VSCODE and its various tools as my sandbox.
I used A.I to help me brain storm on solutions and teach me java syntax.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

Java is a object oriented programing language that can run any platform that supports it without needing to be recopiled. This makes java super popular because can be used to do a lot and it can run pretty much anywhere.

# Future Work

- Item I neeed to make a jframe and set things up for the gui and put that all into its own class.
- Item 2 I want to make user input possible so I can make custom skills and record them to a file for later.
- Item 3 I need to make the buttons for the gui that will enable the actual interaction between user and software.
